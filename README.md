SEONGJU

SEONGJU is my Cafe name and for this assignment I have chosen to build a website that will showcase the different drinks and food that SEONGJU has to offer. Being a cafe website I would like the user to navigate between the pages with ease and I would also like them to view the different promotions and deals at their own accord. Most importantly, I wanted my website to be simple, intuitive and aesthetically pleasing.

Design Process

This cafe website is for anyone that would like to know more about the products that SEONGJU sells - the drinks and food. I built this website with the idea in mind that I would like the user to use this website naturally. In doing so, I have specifically placed the menu items in a specific way so that the users can see it as a whole. The navigation bar at the top of the menu helps them to navigate between the different pages. My website gives the users an overview of the menu items, the promotions and deals, the reviews from other customers, the contacts as well as the sign up membership page.

     User stories:
     - As a user, you can press the respective headings in the navigation bar to directly go into that site.

     - As a user, you can go to the contact page and email us questions or call us if there are any specific arrangements that you would like us to do.

     - As a user, you can go to our sign up page to sign up as a member so that you will receive a 10% discount on the products that you purchased.

     - As a user, you can go into the menu page to view the different drinks and food that our cafe has to offer and there are also information about them below their respective name.

     - As a user, you can go into the promotion page to view the different promotions of different products

     - As a user, you can also go into the review page to see the opinions of other people on our products.

Features

There are many features incoporated into this cafe website.

Website

1. I have also done the resizing of the viewports to ensure that the elements of my website can be easily viewed on the different screen sizes.

Menu Page

1. In the menu page, users can hover over the food and drinks to make it bigger. If the users over the image itself, it will also make itself bigger to make it easier for viewers to see it.

2. In the menu page, a simple typing animation will greet the users before they begin their journey in this website.

Promotion Page

1. In the promotion page, viewers will see a fading image animation (the images used are the layout of the cafe).

2. Following that, the page also has an image slider animation that allow users to see the different discounted products. The image slider, by default, will automatically switch to the next image. However, this image slider animation is very intuitive, if viewers would like to see the previous image they can simply drag it back to see it, alternatively they can press the buttons at the bottom.

Review Page

1. In the review page, the animations that I used is the animation on scroll. This would make my wesite more aesthetically pleasing. Although it is not an interactive feature, i still used it to enhance the appearanc of my website.

2. The review page also includes a hover effect, where users can hover over the different review containers and the containers will be bigger.

Contact Page

1. The contact page is a very simple page that has only very simple feature which is the automatic moving and pointing down arrow. The arrow is always moving up and down and is pointing down to a button which prompts users to press it if they have any enquiries.

Membership Page

1. For the membership page, users are required to fill in the necessary details before submitting. Upon submitting, a simple pop-up page that will appear from the centre will greet the users.
